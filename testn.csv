" Hotel Cleanliness   Upon arriving in my room I noticed a smell. I thought it was due to the person who was inside before, so I opened the windows and left out to the city.  When I came back the smell was still there. I assume it is the general cleanliness of the room.  The water in the shower goes every now and then first to extreme cold then to boiling hot for 2 seconds and then back to the temperature. I noticed that in all my 5 stays in the new hotel.   Was not able to watch TV ¬¥due to a problem.  Did not have internet for the first hour I was there. I left the hotel afterwards and internet was working again when I came back at 2 AM the next day. This problem happened the second time in my last 5 stays in that hotel.  The gym is extremely small with not enough equipment. It can not accommodate more than 4 people.   Air Conditioner is set to a standard flow, which is extremely low.   The hotel staff was talking about hotel guests in a rude manner in front of me. Maybe due to thinking, that I can't speak German. When I ordered a coffee in uniform, staff gave me the full price. I asked for the crew discount and staff replied with a sarcastic tone and a weird smile "" Sure, crew discount""."
"   Excellent Performance    I am writing to you today regarding one of your crew, and his exceptional performance on ek421.

From the briefing room Colby demonstrated a positive and motivated attitude, engaging and showing his knowledge of all recent updates. During boarding he used the kiss tablet to identify the parents of another crew travelling with us and ensured that they had everything that they needed. Colby introduced himself to visually impaired passenger 61C on previous sector (ek420) and personalised his service to provide all the information she needed regarding safety and service. Colby worked beyond expectations with his teamwork, going out of his way to assist his colleagues. Helping with family with infants offering them extra seats to improve their comfort during the flight. After we had finished the service in economy Colby offered to help out in business class cabin. He used great intuitive during tasks, with an impressive focus on preparation for the services. He shared a quote with the rest of the team, ‚Äòfailing to prepare, is preparing to fail‚Äô which was an important point to make, and his colleagues were inspired. Finally Colby demonstrated exceptional image and uniform standards throughout both sectors. And I believe he would be perfect for the business promotions team due to his personality, presentation and obvious passion for the brand."

"To the attention of CCM Jo Anne Warda I would like to bring to your attention that crew member Porntipa Chau has exhibited all that it takes to be a professional First class crew member at heart. Her knowledge about the First class product is intact. Her galley was kept organized at all times. Right from the pre departure duties during boarding, CSV Nataliia Shams Eddin (staff no: 379140) who is also a service trainer and myself could understand that her qualities were outstanding and one to be trusted for executing a fine dining experience. Porntipa led her First class team by preparing on a trolley all the First class products (as per service sequence), ensuring that the Jute bag was offered separately on a large silver trip along with the other give aways. (Most crew tend to do a short cut by placing all the items in the Jute bag, not displaying our products properly. She was very organized in the galley by preparing in advance and labelling several stowage (where to find what) for easy and quick reference. She also ensured that all the paperwork was done inclusive of the 'galley duty free form' which is mandatory for Shanghai. She assisted the flight deck crew, thus alleviating pressure from the Cabin Supervisor in Economy who could focus entirely on his customers. Although she is Thai, Porntipa studied Mandarin at university and acted as a translator several times during this flight coming to the rescue of more than one customer and crew alike."

She was always on hand assisting me in the galley and would prepare each step of the service for me  Instead of throwing out the leftover juices, she prepared trays and offered them in the cabin without having to be asked showing great initiative  She also assisted her colleagues to prepare the cabin at the outstation after completing her area"
"Slow and chaotic disembarkation Arrival Gate was G1 Aircraft landed at 06:35 am Last PAX left the aircraft at 07:10 Two stairs were used initially at L1 and L2 door. No first class bus was provided for the First class pax. She had to travel in the business class coach waiting for all due to segregation. After the business class coaches left the L1 door was closed on the request of the EKAS staff. However there was no stairs at the L5 door and the L1 door stairs was unusable, as the busses behind blocked it. Both EKAS supervisor and the dispatcher on duty were blaming each other when inquired. Most of the customers were transiting to US. Segragating customers from one available door on a full capacity flight in economy and business obviously wasn't the best option. Customers were complaining about the delay in disembarkation before leaving the aircraft."
